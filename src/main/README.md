Demonstration of persoo features
-------------------------------

Each demo use-case is in separate folder. See 'target' folder as example. 
It is a good start for creation of new demo use-case.

Configurations:

* 'demo/demo-nav-config.js' -- top hierarchy displayed in top navigation. Contains hierarchy of use-cases.
* 'demo/[use-case-name]/local-nav-config.js' -- side bar displaying pages, which are part of this use-case.
* 'demo/[use-case-name]/workflow.js' -- workflow, which is realizing this use case (apikey in html and this config must be the same).
